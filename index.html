          <h2>I design secure systems, automate what slows companies down, and build the AI that accelerates what matters.</h2>
          <p>
            I've managed 700+ compute nodes and 400+ AI accelerators at Tenstorrent, built data
            pipelines that saved manufacturers millions at Jabil, and led distributed engineering
            teams across continents. I know what it takes to transform an organization's
            infrastructure — because I've done it, repeatedly, at scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Tenstorrent, I pioneered Agentic AI solutions that cut support ticket volume by 70%
            and saved teams hours of manual work daily. I automated provisioning for 600+ servers,
            reduced hardware deployment from weeks to hours, and transitioned a reactive IT
            organization into a proactive Platform Engineering team serving 800+ engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was a Data Architect at Jabil — building near real-time analytics
            pipelines for global factory operations, converting monolithic systems to microservices,
            and leading zero-data-loss migrations. That foundation in data architecture and
            operational automation shapes everything I build today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since going independent, I've shipped over twenty production systems in three months —
            proving I can move fast without cutting corners. I pick the right tool for the job
            and own every layer from the server rack to the user interface.

            AI classifies queries into intent, a 4-layer relevance scoring engine ranks results
            in real-time via SSE streaming, and Prometheus + OpenTelemetry trace every request
            from ingestion to render. One query, dozens of sources, full observability.

          <h3>Architecture-first thinking</h3>
          <p>
            Every system I build starts with architecture — the right patterns, the right boundaries,
            the right failure modes. I've designed platforms spanning 700+ compute nodes across
            datacenters, and I run my own infrastructure now: bare-metal servers, Kubernetes, Helm,
            Harbor, Vault, Prometheus. I think in systems, not features.

          <h3>Right tool, right job</h3>
          <p>
            Rust when correctness and performance matter. Go for concurrent services. Python for
            rapid iteration and ML. C when you need to talk directly to hardware. TypeScript for
            rich UIs. I don't have a favorite language — I have favorite outcomes.

          <h3>AI as leverage, not theater</h3>
          <p>
            At Tenstorrent, I built MCP agents that cut support tickets 70% and saved a team
            4-5 hours daily on manual query resolution. I integrate AI where it creates real value —
            not to add a chatbot to everything, but to solve problems that were previously impractical.

          <h3>Security as architecture</h3>
          <p>
            Security isn't a checklist you run at the end — it's how you design the system from day one.
            Vault for secrets management, certificate-based authentication, encrypted storage at rest,
            zero-trust networking, automated credential rotation. I've managed infrastructure serving
            800+ engineers where a breach would halt product development. That shapes how I build everything.
