          <h2>I architect AI agent systems grounded in real infrastructure — from bare metal to coordinated teams of agents that ship.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm building Agent MA — an AI agent platform where agents have layered personas,
            measurable competency levels, and defined roles. They coordinate as a team,
            learn from every interaction, and get better over time. The platform is built
            by the same agent team it's designed to sell — proof of concept and product in one.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Tenstorrent, I pioneered Agentic AI before it was a category — building
            MCP-based agents that cut support ticket volume by 70% and saved teams hours
            of manual work daily. I managed 700+ compute nodes and 400+ AI accelerators,
            automated provisioning for 600+ servers, and transitioned a reactive IT
            organization into a proactive Platform Engineering team serving 800+ engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I was a Data Architect at Jabil — building near real-time analytics
            pipelines for global factory operations, converting monolithic systems to microservices,
            and leading zero-data-loss migrations. That foundation in data architecture, hardware
            infrastructure, and operational automation shapes every AI system I build today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since going independent, I've shipped over twenty production systems in three months —
            from AI agent platforms to federated search engines to bare-metal orchestration.
            I own every layer from the server rack to the user interface.

          <p>
            Every system I build starts with architecture — the right boundaries, the right failure
            modes, the right agent roles. I've designed platforms spanning 700+ compute nodes
            across datacenters, and now I architect AI agent systems on bare metal: Kubernetes,
            Helm, Harbor, Vault, Prometheus. I think in systems, not features.

          <p>
            Rust when correctness and performance matter. Go for concurrent services. Python for
            rapid iteration and ML. C when you need to talk directly to hardware. TypeScript for
            rich UIs. I don't have a favorite language — I have favorite outcomes.

            At Tenstorrent, I built MCP agents that cut support tickets 70%. Now I'm building
            coordinated multi-agent teams with layered personas, competency tracking, and role
            enforcement. AI that operates like a trained team — not a chatbot bolted onto a dashboard.

          <p>
            Security isn't a checklist you run at the end — it's how you design the system from day one.
            Vault for secrets management, certificate-based authentication, encrypted storage at rest,
            zero-trust networking, automated credential rotation. I've managed infrastructure serving
            800+ engineers where a breach would halt product development. That shapes how I build everything.
